## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light slate blue (#778DA9) for a modern, calm aesthetic, hinting at the university environment.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean and non-distracting backdrop, similar to the image in the user's prompt.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#41B3A3) for interactive elements and highlights, contrasting effectively while remaining subtle.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif. The letter forms have a neutral, objective style, making them well-suited to conveying lots of factual information efficiently.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for event categories and navigation, in the muted teal accent color.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout with ample whitespace for a modern look, emulating the simplicity of the calendar in the user prompt.
- Employ subtle animations, like fade-ins and smooth transitions, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
